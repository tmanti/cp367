The "who am i" command prints out information about all the users who are currently logged in. The "who am i" command has the same output as if you were to use the regular "who" command with the '-m' option, printing out information with "only the hostname and user asscociated with stdin". The "whoami" command prints out just the username of the current user (the user who ran the command).
